# Space Byte
Space Byte is a Unity 2D shooter game that I built from scratch during my reading week at York Univeristy (Oct 11-18) of the year 2019.

## Objects
### Game Control
Use the "left" and "right" arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right. Use the "up" and "down" arrow keys to move the spaceship up and down.
### Screen Layout
The dimensions of the screen are variable to the relative size of the device(iOS and Android). No fixed parameters: vertical and horizontal dimensions.
### Score Board
Increases score when spaceship picks up green powerups. Drops down to zero when the spaceship collides with a an enemy projectile.
